# Group 26 Project Introduction

## **ThreeJS Projects**
Farm-like Simulator

---

## Explanation

This project is a real-time, interactive 3D farm-like simulator built with Three.js.  
It features dynamic seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter), weather systems (sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, stormy, foggy), and day-night cycles.  
Users can experience natural environmental changes—such as cherry blossoms in spring, fireflies in summer, falling leaves in autumn, and auroras or snow in winter—along with realistic lighting, clouds, rain, wind, and puddle effects.  
All effects are modular and respond instantly to user interactions or real-world weather data, providing a rich and immersive simulation environment[1][2].

## **Installation**

```bash
# Installation commands

cd ThreeJSUTS26
npm install
```

**Key Features**

- Real-time simulation of seasons and weather, including spring cherry blossoms, summer fireflies, autumn leaves, and winter auroras/snow[1].
- Modular particle systems for clouds, rain, snow, wind, and fog, each with create, update, and remove functions for efficient resource management[1].
- Dynamic sun and moon lighting, with smooth day-night transitions and special night effects like stars and a supermoon[1].
- Responsive environment: grass and sky colors, lighting, and ambient effects change automatically with season and weather[1].
- Level of Detail (LOD) control for performance optimization on various devices[1].
- Integration with real-world weather APIs for automatic synchronization to your current location[2].
- User interaction via buttons and hotkeys for instant switching between seasons and weather conditions[1].
- Realistic puddle and water accumulation effects during rain using physically-based materials[1].
